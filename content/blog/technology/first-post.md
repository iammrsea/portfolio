Evan You, the creator of Vue, introduced [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) just a couple months ago. I was excited about the announcement because it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for at the time: a minimalist, optimized, content-first static site generator that trivializes the process of fusing together markdown assets with dynamic layouts and components. I read through the docs and tried it out.

```js
function print() {
  console.log("This is a javaScript function");
}
```

```bash
npm install
```

```java
class Animal{
  public Animal(){

  }
  public void bark(){
    System.out.println("Not all animals can bark");
  }
}
```
