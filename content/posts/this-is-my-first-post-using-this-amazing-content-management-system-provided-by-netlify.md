## The post in detail
This is supposed to be the full post and I am glad to be writing it a big grin on my face. I am loving netlifycms already and I am sure gonna build a couple of projects with it. It is pretty cool.
### Let me add a bit of JavaScript code
```js
const printLine = () => {
console.log("this is ES6 arrow function demo");
}
```
### I could also write a bit of Java code. I love writing in Java
```java
class Animal{
private String name;
public Animal(name){
this.name = name;
}
```
