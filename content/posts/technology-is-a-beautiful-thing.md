I love the idea of using netlifycms, it makes life easy and writing posts fun. I could attach images in the middle of the posts if I choose to

This is the first image i would be attaching

![first image](/images/uploads/me3.jpg "This is my photo")

Let me writing some JavaScript code because I love writing in it

```js
function printLine() {
  console.log("This is a function to print message on the console");
}
```

I could also add some Java because I also love me some Java

```java
class Animal{
private String name;
public Animal(){
}
public void setName(String name){
this.name= name;
}
public String getName(){
return this.name;
}
}
```
